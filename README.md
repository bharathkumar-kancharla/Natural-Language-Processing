- *Named Entity Recognition* - This can determine whether a word or word-group represents a place,organization, or anything else.
- *Chatbot* - The most talked-about application of NLP is Chatbot. It can find the intent of the question asked by a user and send an appropriate reply, achieved through the training process.
