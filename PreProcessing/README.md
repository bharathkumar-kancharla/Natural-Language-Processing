This repository contains codes for various preprocessing steps that need to done during NLP process

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Tokenization  --> Breaking down text into words and sentences
2. Stopword Removal --> Filtering common words
3. N-Grams --> Identifying commonly groups of words
4. Word Sense Disambiguation --> Identifying the context in which the word occurs
5. Parts-of-Speech  --> Identifying Part-of-Speech
6. Stemming  --> Removing ends of the words
7. Lemmatizing --> similar to stemming, but the difference is that the result of lemmatizing is a real word.
8. Counter Vectorization --> It that takes any mass of text and returns each unique word as a feature, with a count of the number of times a particular word occurs in the text.
9. TF-IDF Score --> TF is the ratio representing the count of specific words to the total number of words in a document.
